-- Create a new file named group_by_exercises.sql


-- In your script, use DISTINCT to find the unique titles in the titles table. 
-- How many unique titles have there ever been? 
-- Answer that in a comment in your SQL file.


-- Write a query to find a list of all unique last names that start and end with 'E' using GROUP BY.


-- Write a query to to find all unique combinations of first and last names of all employees whose last names start and end with 'E'.


-- Write a query to find the unique last names with a 'q' but not 'qu'. 
-- Include those names in a comment in your sql code.


-- Add a COUNT() to your results for exercise 5 to find the number of employees with the same last name.


-- Find all employees with first names 'Irena', 'Vidya', or 'Maya'. 
-- Use COUNT(*) and GROUP BY to find the number of employees with those names for each gender.


-- Using your query that generates a username for all employees, generate a count of employees with each unique username.


-- From your previous query, are there any duplicate usernames? 
-- What is the highest number of times a username shows up? 
-- Bonus: How many duplicate usernames are there?



-- Bonus: More practice with aggregate functions:

-- Determine the historic average salary for each employee. 
-- When you hear, read, or think "for each" with regard to SQL, you'll probably be grouping by that exact column.


-- Using the dept_emp table, count how many current employees work in each department. 
-- The query result should show 9 rows, one for each department and the employee count.


-- Determine how many different salaries each employee has had. 
-- This includes both historic and current.


-- Find the maximum salary for each employee.


-- Find the minimum salary for each employee.


-- Find the standard deviation of salaries for each employee.


-- Find the max salary for each employee where that max salary is greater than $150,000.


-- Find the average salary for each employee where that average salary is between $80k and $90k.
